= Vale Gradle Plugin

Plugin for running https://valelint.github.io/[ValeLint] as part of a Gradle build.

The plugin will check if the `vale` executable is available in PATH.
If it is not, the appropriate package will be downloaded from https://github.com/ValeLint/vale/releases.

The plugin will also respect a local `.vale` config file and styles dir.
If these are missing, bundled config and styles files will be used.
